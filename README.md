# MusicPlayer
A project through the www.udacity.com Android Basics Nanodegree.
Asked to create the structure of a music player app based off the principles taught up to this point.
Project is meant to test multiple activies and uses OnClickListners
Much of the listed entries are examples and are not meant to scale with the app.
Improvements to the app would be made using ContentResolver and AudioManager
